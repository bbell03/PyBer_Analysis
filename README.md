The average fare per ride for urban cities is $24.53, the average fare per ride for suburban cities is $30.97 and the average fare per ride for rural cities is $24.53. 

There is an average fare per driver of $16.57 for urban cities, an average fare per driver of $39.50 for suburban cities and an average fare per driver of $55.49 for rural cities. 
    
These average values are likely skewed relative to population size and outlying values in rural and suburban cities when compared to urban cities.
  

## Summary:
    
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)

    Dear Rideshare CEO,

    You should:
        1. Hire more drivers in rural areas to make the cost per ride more affordable.
        2. Create price incentives for using rideshare during warm weather, especially in urban, but also suburban areas.
        3. Set a price floor for urban rides to better ensure driver's time is consistently worth their money earned.
